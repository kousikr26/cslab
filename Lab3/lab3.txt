A left bracket is one of the following characters
  1. (
  2. {
  3. [
  4. <
  5. |

A right bracket is one of the following characters
  1. )
  2. {
  3. [
  4. >
  5. |

For each left bracket, the corresponding right bracket is the
bracket of the corresponding number, for example '[' matches ']'.

The sequence of brackets is  balanced if anyof the following conditions are met;

1. The sequence one among  (), {}, [], <> , | |
2. The sequence consists of two parts A and B where A and B are both balanced .
3. The sequence  can be written as xAy where x is a left bracket and y is the corresponding right bracket and A is a sequence which is balanced.

Write a C++ program to checj is a sequence of brackets is balanced
