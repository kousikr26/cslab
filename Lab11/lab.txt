Q1. Design an algorithm to check if a given graph is bipartite
Q2. Design an algorithm to check if a given weighted graph (weights are integers) has a cycle of odd weight.

Input Output Specification
Q1.
Input
The first line of the algorithm contains two numbers n and m indicating the number of vertices and the number of edges respectively.
The each  next m lines contains a pair of number indicating an edge.
Output
YES if the graph is bipartite
NO otherwise

Q2.
Input
The first line of the algorithm contains two numbers n and m indicating the number of vertices and the number of edges respectively.
The each  next m lines contains three  numbesr indicating an edge and its weight. The last integer denotes the weight
Output
YES if the graph  has a cycle of odd weight.
NO otherwise.
